Hi! I am Ziqi (Kenny) Wang, a IFP student (2025.09 â€“ ) in the [BSc (Hons) Computer Science](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/2025/computer-science/) at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/). My personal tutors is [Mr. Syed Murad](https://syedmurad.com/)

My hobbies
======
As a seventeen-year-old, I am deeply passionate about computer science and spend a lot of my free time coding and exploring new technologies. I also have a huge interest in aviation and can often be found taking [photos of aircraft](https://2730474829398.github.io/photos/) around airports. My goal for the future is to merge these two passions by developing an AI-powered tool that can intelligently identify flight information, as well as creating an assistant software to help people find the most budget-friendly flight tickets.
